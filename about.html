        <p>Once there was a dog who wandered the streets night and day in search of food.
             One day, he found a big juicy bone and he immediately grabbed it between his mouth 
             and took it home. On his way home, he crossed a river and saw another dog who also 
             had a bone in its mouth. He wanted that bone for himself too. But as he opened his mouth, 
             the bone he was biting fell into the river and sank. That night, he went home hungry.</p>
